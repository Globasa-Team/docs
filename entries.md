# Rhymes

All entries except phrases should list rhymes. All rhyme words should be listed together (not strong first, then weak, etc).

Our working minimum algorithm for a rhyme is:

- The last two letters must be the same, but if the last two letters are consonants then it must be at least the last three letters.

But while listing rhymes of a term, there are several rules of when not to list the term. They are:

1. Don't show phrases that rhyme with this term
2. Don't show affixes that rhyme with this term
3. Don't show derived words that share the same last morpheme as this derived term.
4. Don't show derived words that use the current term as the last morpheme
5. Don't show root words that use an affix version of the current term as the last morpheme (eg. kal shouldn't show words ending with + -kal)
6. Special case: when showing rhymes for an affix, make sure the words shown aren't the root form of the current term. (Eg. -kal should show words with +kal)

Use the heading Rhyming Words not Ending in %1$s and list either the final morpheme of this term if derived or phrase, or this term if a root.

Root words and proper words have no derived etymology. Derived words and phrases do. Affixes are treated different from either, as with the above rules.
